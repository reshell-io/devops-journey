## Object Storage in Cloud

### Description:

S3 is a file storage (also called an object storage). It allows you to store your files. Files are stored inside an S3 Bucket. A bucket is just a fancy word for ‘Folder’. AWS S3 guarantees that your files will never be lost. 

### Steps:

- Install aws-cli (or gcloud for GCP)) in your terminal. (Documentation for aws-cli: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Create a file inside terminal called test3.txt
- Put some text inside the file.
- Go to your AWS account and search S3 in the search bar at the top (Cloud Storage for GCP).
- Create an S3 bucket (Documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html)
- Upload file to S3 from your terminal. (Do this using aws-cli)
